# @jsurrea Personal Website

This is the source code used to build my personal website, which is hosted on GitHub Pages. The website is built using [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/), a Jekyll theme designed for personal blogs and portfolios.

To build your own, check the following resources:
- [Getting Started with Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/)
- [Write your first post](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/write-a-new-post/)
- [Showcase](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/text-and-typography/)

The magic of this template is that it allows you to write your posts in Markdown, which is a lightweight markup language that is easy to read and write. The focus becomes the content, not the formatting ðŸ˜„
